# 📈 HDFC Bank Stock Price Prediction using LSTM with Explainable AI

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to forecast HDFC Bank stock prices based on historical closing prices. It integrates **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to make model predictions interpretable, enabling insight into how past stock movements influence future forecasts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- LSTM-based time series forecasting model
- Predicts next **10-day** and **30-day** stock prices
- Visualizations for actual vs predicted prices
- SHAP explainability: Waterfall, Bar, and Custom Contribution Plots
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score

## 💡 Explainable AI with SHAP

SHAP explains the contribution of each input (past stock value) to the model's final prediction.

- **Waterfall Plot**: Breaks down how each day impacts the prediction
